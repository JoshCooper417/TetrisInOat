 - add implicit subtype of Object for class declarations with no superclass?
 - more generally, how are Object's methods/fields handled?

 - allow subtype on exp_new ?

 - change if? to also check types (i.e. only checks null, not cast) 
   [Note for future: combine both types of downcast into one construct?]
